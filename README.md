# My digital resume | rafagomes.github.io

I developed my digital resume with one idea in mind, to make a professional website and have example on how I usually develop my projects.
The website is built on React consuming a content in JSON.

Feel free to use the base if that would help you and make questions or give me some feedbacks.

## Tech stack details

-   React 16
-   Styles built with Emotion.sh
-   Tests made using Jest and Enzyme
-   Atomic design as my pattern's choice
-   Webpack under the hood
-   Typescript to be professional
-   Babel transpiling everything
-   Preetier to keep things looking good
-   Yarn, well, I love Yarn
-   Content made with JSON

## To do
